title: Code Quality Challenge - Part 1 
---

Yep! Is that time of the year again! You know, we are already in the second part of the year, that feeling of the year slipping by you, and you try to get a hold of it by doing more, and for me, this time, doing more means coding outside work hours and writing more.

So that's how this blog post was born. I stumbled upon Ben Orenstein's [30-Day Code Quality Challenge](https://www.codequalitychallenge.com/) and decided that it was something that I wanted to do. The commitment is only 20 minutes a day, and while I that very little can be accomplished during that time, at least it will get me into the habit of doing more which is my goal right now. Just hope that the habit sticks.

Since I will be documenting my journey through the 30-day challenge here in my blog, let's talk about the format of it. It will be a 3 part post (this is part 1), and each part will contain my notes for each of the 10 days.

Now that we know what all this is about let get down to business!

# Day 1 - Clean up your README

The gist of this challenge is to take a project where you are a contributor/maintainer/owner, and apply some house keeping on the README. The idea is that a good README will save time for new comers while trying to use/contribute to the project.

I have to say that this one was a bit tricky for me since at the moment, I am working on [Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry) and [Cloud Foundry Incubator](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator) Open Source Projects and the projects that I work on have very detailed README.md files.

However, I did went on and added a couple of details to the README.md og a project that I worked for a bit a couple of months ago. [This was the result of it.](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/gcp-broker-proxy/pull/6/files)

*Notes of that day:* 20 mins is not much time. I spent much of the time, looking for something meaningful to add. Got distracted by a question on my team slack, and barely had time to complete a very simple change. Will make an effort on blocking external distractions tomorrow.

# Day 2 - TBD
