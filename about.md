Software Engineer, my weapon of choice(at the moment) is **Ruby** and **Ruby on Rails**, but I have certain proficiency in **Javascript** and working hard to get better at it everyday since I believe that JS is the language of the web adn seeing how each day more people are flocking to it. Besides I strongly believe in the use *the right tool for the job*, Ruby/Ruby on Rails are not the solution to all problems.

I believe in testing, so I develop using the TDD aproach (rspec as testing tool, ffaker to create test data, capybara to test in the browser)

In a past life I worked on some .NET and Java(in college) projects, working with those platform/languages it's not something I strive for but I wouldn't be opposed to using them if a project have some specific qualities that warrants the use of one or another.

For the last 2 years I've been working for a company called [Pixel Perfect Tree](http://www.pixelpt.com/), which is a Ruby on Rails shop based on Santo Domingo, DR., where I have worked on numerous projects of different categories as

- Video Platform
- E-commerce Application
- CRM

Also I helped managed the Dev Ops of these projects, not that I am Dev Ops ninja or anything close to it, but I can defend myself in that area if the situation requires me to.

##Technologies - Services - Tools

- AWS (EC2, Elastic Cache, RDS PosgreSQL/MySQL)
- Redis (caching)
- Chef for provisioning/managing servers
- RESTful APIs
- Heroku
- Background jobs (sidekiq gem mostly)
- HTML/CSS
- Git/Github/Git-flow


### More Information

I love learning. I'm the happiest when I'm learning something new, it could be anything a new languge, new tool, new practice, new pattern. 

I love reading. I read everything on the internet useful or not. It's a blessing and a curse, on one hand I'm always up to date on what's happening on the tech sceneor I can suggest new solutions based on something I read recently but on the other hand this takes so much of my time that some days I feel that I didn't do anything except working and reading.

I love sports.
