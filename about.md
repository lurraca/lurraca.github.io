Software Engineer at [Pivotal](http://pivotal.io) where lately I been doing mostly **Java/SpringBoot** and **Javascript/Angular1-2**, although my background has been for the most part of my career on **Ruby/Ruby on Rails**. During my free time I been lately I have been learning **ReactJS**, I like the simplicity of the component model, small learning curve and vibrant community. Ultimately I strongly believe in the use *the right tool for the job*.

I practice Extreme Programming which means I breathe **Test Driven Development**, **Pair Programming**, **Continuous Integration** and building products in **Iterations**.

### More Information

I love learning. I’m the happiest when I’m learning something new. It could be anything, a new language, new tool, new practice, new pattern.

I love reading. I read everything on the internet useful or not. It’s a blessing and a curse, on one hand I am fairly up todate on what’s happening on the tech scene and also allows me to suggest new solutions based on something I read recently but on the other hand this steal time from other activities which me makes me think that some days I didn’t do anything except working and reading.

I love food and sports. (Follow me on the #gram for more details on that)[http://instagram.com/lurraca06]
